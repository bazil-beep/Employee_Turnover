# Employee Turnover Analytics

This project analyzes employee turnover data using Python and machine learning techniques to identify patterns, trends, and potential causes of employee attrition. It aims to help HR teams and management make informed decisions to improve retention.

---

##  Problem Statement

To identify the factors that influence employee attrition and predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company.

---

##  Dataset
The dataset contains employee-related features such as:
- Age
- Department
- Education
- Job Role
- Monthly Income
- Overtime
- Years at Company
- Job Satisfaction
- Performance Rating
- Attrition (Target variable)

> Dataset is stored in: `Employee_Turnover.csv` (or your uploaded CSV name)

---

## âš™ Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (for Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  ML Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

---

##  Key Insights

- **Overtime** has a strong impact on attrition.
- **Job Satisfaction** and **Work-Life Balance** are correlated with retention.
- **Monthly Income** and **Years at Company** are important predictors.

##  Model Performance

| Model                | Accuracy |
|---------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression | 83%      |
| Decision Tree       | 85%      |
| Random Forest       | 88%      |

---

##  Conclusion

- High overtime and low job satisfaction are key drivers of attrition.
- Random Forest gave the best result with 88% accuracy.
- HR should focus on employee wellness and proper compensation to retain talent.
